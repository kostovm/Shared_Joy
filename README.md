# My First React App

Welcome to my first React app and the first full project I built during my SoftUni courses. This app was created from the idea stage to the views. Please note that I took this course before completing my CSS course, so the design might not be great, but the functionality is working as expected.

## App Overview

The app allows parents to gift their children's old items to other parents. Users can offer items they no longer need or search for items they are looking to receive. The giver has the ability to choose the recipient for the gift.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. In the main folder, run:
   `npm install`
2. Navigate to the `client` folder and run:
   `npm install`
3. In the `server` folder, run:
   `node server`
4. Finally, in the `client` folder, run:
   `npm run dev`

## Server Information

The server used in this app is a practice server provided by SoftUni. It comes with initial data, but please note that this data resets every time the server is restarted.
