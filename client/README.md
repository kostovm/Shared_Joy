Project Title: Shared Joy

Description:
Shared Joy is a platform designed to connect parents, allowing them to share items their children have outgrown. Users can both create offers for items they wish to share and submit requests to receive products from fellow users. The platform ensures privacy by providing personal information only to offer creators and only for users who have expressed interest in their products.
